# Jev Codex Router

[![ci](https://github.com/0xNatoshi/jev-codex-router/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/0xNatoshi/jev-codex-router/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Per-turn model routing for Codex, driven by [Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai) (TypeSafe System One).**

Every turn is classified by Jev and served by the cheapest model that can handle
it, at a thinking depth adapted to the task — instead of running everything on
the frontier model. The decision costs ≈ $0.00003 and ≈ 0.6 s per turn.

**Measured savings: ≈ −60 % vs a full-frontier baseline** on a 7-day replay of
237 real turns — protocol, tables and limitations in [BACKTEST.md](BACKTEST.md).
Installing with an AI agent? Hand it [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

This is not a fork of any router: it plugs into an existing local
**Codex Router** installation through its official extension points
(a *generic provider* + a *curated model*), so router updates never overwrite it.

## How it works

```

                            │ 2. apply the routing policy
                            │    (model, reasoning.effort, service_tier)

```

- **Responses in, Responses out** — no format conversion; the SSE stream is
  relayed verbatim, so tool calls, reasoning and compaction behave natively.
- **Fail-open** — any Jev error keeps the turn alive (safe fallback route).
- **Kill switch** — a sentinel file routes without Jev, instantly.
- **Codex-dry tandem** — when native (ChatGPT) usage is exhausted (sentinel
  file, or an observed 429 / usage-limit response), the triptych is replaced:
  GLM (`opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash`) for frontier-tier steps, deepseek
  (`opencode-go/deepseek-v4.1-flash`) for everything else. The failed call is
  retried on the tandem; the next successful native call clears an auto flip.
- **Decision log** — every routed turn is logged locally for calibration
  (`~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router-live.jsonl`), never published.

## Routing policy

| Tier | Model | Thinking | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mechanical / clearly scoped | `gpt-5.6-luna` | **always max** | `priority` (fast lane; cheap enough that 2× is negligible) |
| Standard implementation | `gpt-5.6-sol` | adaptive (Jev depth) | standard |
| Hard / ambiguous | `gpt-6-astra` | adaptive (Jev depth) | standard |

When Jev's confidence is below the gate (`0.5`, tunable), the router **does not
downgrade**: the turn falls back to the **middle tier** (Sol) and the decision
is logged — a backtest over real sessions showed that falling back to the
frontier model instead eats ~80% of the savings (see `poc/BACKTEST.md`).

One measured exception: a **clean mechanical continuation** (tool step, no
error, low/medium depth) that Jev wanted on **Luna** keeps Luna on the priority
lane. Live data (1 day, 1 065 calls) showed 59% of calls were otherwise held to
Sol, including ~173/day of Luna-on-mechanics picks (~10× cheaper on Luna) —
those now log as `hold(luna_step)`.

### Codex-dry tandem — only while native usage is exhausted

The triptych is the policy **unless** the ChatGPT usage window is exhausted
(manual sentinel file, or an automatic flip on a 429 / usage-limit response,
which also retries the failed call on the tandem). While dry:

| Native tier | Dry substitute |
|---|---|
| `gpt-6-astra` (frontier) | `opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash` |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` / `gpt-5.6-luna` | `opencode-go/deepseek-v4.1-flash` |

An automatic flip expires after 30 minutes (re-probe) and is cleared by the
first successful native call; the manual sentinel file is never auto-cleared.

## Quickstart

Prerequisites: macOS, a Codex desktop install wired to a **Codex Router**
(checkout with `bin/codex-router`), Python 3.11+, and a TypeSafe API key (Jev).

**1. Give the server your TypeSafe key** — either
`export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...` in the service environment, or:

```bash
echo 'TYPESAFE_API_KEY=your-key' >> ~/.hermes/.env   # default env file
# (override the path with JEV_ENV_FILE=/path/to/env)
```

**2. Start the server** (foreground test):

```bash
python3 server/jev_server.py
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4319/health
```

**3. Register with the Codex Router:**

```bash
cd <codex-router checkout>

# share the native ChatGPT session with local clients (revisit if it expires)
./bin/codex-router chatgpt-session enable

# declare the generic provider (our local server, native Responses format)
./bin/codex-router providers generic add jev \
  --name "Jev Router" --base-url http://127.0.0.1:4319/v1 \
  --adapter openai-responses --allow-private

# declare the model: ~/.codex/codex-router/user-models.json
# (this file is local state — router updates won't touch it)
```

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "models": [
    {
      "slug": "jev/auto",
      "gatewayModel": "jev-auto",
      "compHash": "jev-auto-user-v1",
      "upstreamModel": "auto",
      "provider": "jev",
      "listed": true,
      "displayName": "Jev Codex Router",

        { "effort": "xhigh", "description": "Extended reasoning" },

      ],

      "autoCompact": 219640,

    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
# publish the catalog and make the model visible in the picker
./bin/codex-router refresh-catalog
./bin/control picker set jev/auto show
```

**4. Quit and reopen Codex**, then pick **“Jev Codex Router”** in the model picker.
Every turn now gets its own route.

**5. Make it permanent** (optional but recommended): run the service installer
in your own Terminal (launchd management is intentionally restricted inside
supervised agents):

```bash
bash server/install-service.sh
```

Without it, `server/watchdog.sh` (cron every 5 min) restarts the server if it
stops answering.

## Operations

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Watch decisions | `tail -f ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router-live.jsonl` |
| See the picked model in the thread | every reasoning summary part carries the routed tag, separators on both sides: ` · 🧠sol:low · ` — one glyph per route: ⚡ luna (fast) · 🧠 sol (workhorse) · 🚀 astra (frontier) · 🌍 terra; 🐳 deepseek / ✨ glm while the Codex-dry tandem is serving |
| Shadow mode (decide + log, serve astra) | `touch ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.shadow` |
| Debug capture (shapes + raw streams) | `touch ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.debug` |
| Kill switch (no Jev → frontier) | `touch ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.off` (delete the file to re-enable) |
| Force the Codex-dry tandem | `touch ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.codex-dry` (delete the file to return to luna/sol/astra) |
| Inspect the dry auto state | `cat ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.codex-dry.json` (reason + expiry; auto-cleared by the next successful native call) |
| Hive classifier status | `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4319/hive/status` |
| Hide the model | `./bin/control picker set jev/auto hide` |
| Disable the provider | `./bin/codex-router providers generic disable jev` |
| Revoke native sharing | `./bin/codex-router chatgpt-session disable` |
| Service status | `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.thibaultsaintjean.jev-router` |

**After a Codex Router update**, verify nothing was lost:

```bash
./bin/codex-router providers generic list        # shows: SHOW jev
cat ~/.codex/codex-router/model-picker.json      # jev/auto in "visible"
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4319/health
```

### Persistent Hive calibration

The local Hive classifier records only route outcome metadata in
`~/.codex/codex-router/hive-events.jsonl`. At service startup and once per
hour, it rebuilds a rolling 30-day policy in
`~/.codex/codex-router/hive-policy.json`. The policy includes per-model and
per-route-class success rates and recommendations for the dashboard. DeepSeek
is promoted below Luna only after at least eight observations for that class
and a 90% success rate; quarantine and failure safeguards still apply.

The launchd service is configured with `RunAtLoad` and `KeepAlive`, so a laptop
restart starts the router again and immediately refreshes the policy. No
manual retraining command is required. `/hive/status` exposes the last update,
next scheduled update, event count, and current recommendations without
including prompts or tool output.

### Logistic shadow calibration

The router also maintains a small persisted online logistic scorer in
`~/.codex/codex-router/hive-logistic.json`. It learns from transport outcomes
using bounded metadata such as route class, model, effort, context size,
provider compatibility and whether the request was a continuation. It runs in
shadow mode and reports its probability, sample count, log loss and readiness
through `/hive/status`; it cannot change routing by itself.

This separation is intentional. Hive and Jev remain the active decision
policy until the candidate has enough labeled evidence to beat the current
policy on held-out recent traffic. HTTP success is currently recorded as a
transport label, not proof that the task was semantically correct. Future
quality feedback can add accepted, corrected, retried and escalated labels
before the logistic candidate is allowed to influence low-risk routing.

### Optional Jev-align policy improvement

The router includes an offline exporter for
[jev-align](https://github.com/sutro-sh/jev-align). It creates a bounded,
redacted CSV from local routing traces so ambiguous route classes and effort
levels can be human-labeled and evaluated with GEPA. It never runs in the
request path and never applies a proposal automatically:

```bash
python3 scripts/jev_align_export.py
```

See [docs/JEV-ALIGN.md](docs/JEV-ALIGN.md) for validation, labeling, held-out
evaluation, and promotion gates. The upstream project is alpha software and
currently has an MIT/Apache metadata mismatch; this repository uses it as an
optional external tool and does not vendor its code.

### Browser execution boundary

Model routing and computer control are separate decisions. Native browser and
desktop actions use the installed Cua Driver, which provides exact window and
accessibility targeting plus independent verification. The `jev-ultrafast`
path is an opt-in optimization for structured, indexed browser controls only;
it does not replace Cua Driver for arbitrary clicks, uploads, downloads,
dialogs, or native applications. Jev chooses a model for the reasoning turn,
while Cua Driver executes the browser action.

The live `/hive/status` response reports whether `cua-driver` is installed and
the active execution policy, so browser failures are not mistaken for model
routing failures.

### Project guidance maintenance

The router does not silently rewrite repository instructions. The
`instruction-sync` service is the durable owner for AGENTS.md and project
skill updates. It runs from launchd, survives laptop restarts, and records a
reviewable branch and PR plan for configured repositories. Keep it in dry-run
mode until proposed guidance changes have been reviewed; the Jev status
endpoint reports its interval, last run, and pending changes. When a project
needs a new workflow, add a bounded skill with Codex skill tooling, then let
instruction-sync propose the repository change.

## Notes & quirks

- The router's local edge requires `stream: true` — the server always forces it.
- The edge returns SSE with **no Content-Type header**; the server re-emits
  `text/event-stream` because the API forwarder picks its parser from it
  (otherwise it tries to JSON-parse the stream and fails with
  `invalid_responses_response`).
- The shared ChatGPT session authorization has a validity window; re-run
  `chatgpt-session enable` if native routing stops after a while.
- Code comments are in French for now (author's working language) — PRs welcome.

## Security

- **No secrets in this repository.** The server reads `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` from an
  env file or the process environment; everything else stays on your machine.
- The server binds `127.0.0.1` only, talks to your local Codex Router only, and
  never logs prompt content beyond a short task excerpt used for calibration.
- Local decision logs and replay data are git-ignored by default.

## Status

Early, but running in production on the author's setup. The routing policy and
the confidence gate are expected to be calibrated with real usage — the local
decision log is the calibration source.
